My Omarchy's product goal is to run the upstream
[Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) desktop as a native,
hardware-accelerated app on an Apple Silicon Mac.

The current legacy implementation packages a project-built ARM64 Arch Linux
image configured with Omarchy Quattro, a QEMU runtime using Apple Hypervisor
Framework, and a small Swift/AppKit launcher into one macOS app. The approved
My Omarchy specifications preserve this architecture while replacing the
product identity, brand, storage/guest ABI, and release lifecycle. Sections
below that still mention predecessor internals describe the implementation
baseline, not a maintained predecessor distribution.

## Highlights

- Hardware-accelerated ARM64 virtualization and VirGL graphics
- Nested KVM virtualization on M3 and newer Apple Silicon
- Resizable native window with automatic guest resolution and HiDPI scale updates
- Mac audio input/output selection inside Omarchy, with live routing and system-default fallback
- FaceTime HD and other Mac cameras exposed to Omarchy as an on-demand 720p webcam
- Two-way clipboard sharing for text and PNG images between macOS and Omarchy
- One optional shared Mac folder, available inside Omarchy under the same name (`~/Work` stays `~/Work`)
- Loopback-only TCP and UDP port forwarding from the Mac into Omarchy

> **Current limitation:** Video decoding is CPU-only, so playback can be slow, especially at high resolutions. An improved video path is in development.

## Changes in this fork

This fork moves the runtime to QEMU 11.1.1 to pick up Apple's in-hypervisor
GIC, and fixes two audio problems found along the way.

### Component versions

| Component | Upstream | This fork | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QEMU | `cf3e71d8` — 10.2.50, 2026-01-13 | `c3d48b7d` — 11.1.1, 2026-08-26 | First release carrying `hw/intc/arm_gicv3_hvf.c` |
| ARM GIC | GICv2, emulated in QEMU userspace | GICv3 via Hypervisor.framework | Removes the interrupt path from the big QEMU lock |
| Render patch | startergo mega-patch, 29 files | Vendored and trimmed to 18, forward-ported | Upstream is unmaintained since 2026-01-14 and QEMU's display API moved |
| Python build deps | Host interpreter | Pinned `setuptools`, `wheel`, `pip` wheels | QEMU 11.1 builds `qemu.qmp`, and Python 3.12+ dropped `setuptools` |
| Render patch source | Downloaded from the startergo tarball | Vendored in `macos/patches/` | That tree is unmaintained since 2026-01-14; the archive is no longer fetched at all |
| Cocoa keyboard capture | Capture follows the mouse grab | Capture follows the key window | An absolute-pointing guest drops the grab as soon as virtio-tablet binds, leaking host Command chords mid-session |

### What it fixes

**Idle CPU.** QEMU emulated GICv2 in userspace under the big QEMU lock, so
every guest interrupt cost about four lock acquisitions and every IPI about
five across two vCPU threads. The cost scaled with vCPU count and was
independent of what the guest was doing.

| Measured at idle | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QEMU | ~65% of a core | ~15% |
| `coreaudiod` attributable to the VM | 6.4% | 0.3% |
| Total | ~71% | ~15% |

The QEMU figure moved twice: the GIC work took it to ~22%, and clearing the
Cocoa GL dirty flag (below) took it to ~15%. The second measurement was taken
on a freshly booted desktop rather than the same session, so treat the split
between the two as approximate.

Under HVF, QEMU 11.1.1 also rejects GICv2 outright, so this is now the only
supported configuration rather than an optimisation.

**A host audio device held open forever.** `sdl_enable_out` only paused the
device, and QEMU links sdl2-compat over SDL3 where pausing a logical device
leaves the physical one running. The device being held was not even from
playback — `sdl_init_out` opens one at startup purely to negotiate a format,
and nothing released it. The host resampled silence for the life of the VM.
Microphone capture is stricter: its initial device open is deferred until an
Omarchy application actually records, and the device is closed again when the
guest capture stream stops. The first recording may therefore take one device
open longer to begin, but merely launching My Omarchy does not activate the
Mac microphone.

**An unconditional re-render every refresh tick.** The vendored
GPU-resolution patch cleared `gl_dirty` inside an `if (cocoa_gl_trace_enabled())`
block, so in a normal build the flag was never cleared: it latched true on the
first damage and `cocoa_gl_refresh` then blitted the scanout on every tick for
the life of the VM, whether or not anything had changed. The clear now sits at
function scope, where its own comment says it belongs.

**Audio dropouts.** PipeWire reported continuous xruns on a ring 682 ms deep,
with the guest driver using 17 us against a 42 ms deadline. QEMU advances the
emulated Intel HDA DMA position from a 100 Hz timer, so the counter moves in
coarse jumps and ALSA concludes it has missed. Raising the guest's quantum
gives the emulated counter fewer and larger checks to satisfy. A deeper SDL
buffer made this worse, and raising the QEMU main loop to
`QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE` changed nothing, which rules out both buffer
depth and priority inversion.

### Graphics chain

Rendering reaches the GPU through Metal, but nothing in QEMU speaks Metal.
virglrenderer replays the guest's commands as OpenGL ES, and ANGLE translates
those into Metal, which is why the display is started with `gl=es`.

```
Hyprland / Omarchy
  |  OpenGL
  v
Mesa virgl driver                       guest
  |  command stream
  v
virtio-gpu-gl-pci  ─────────────────────────── VM boundary
  |
  v
virglrenderer                           host, replays as OpenGL ES
  |
  v
ANGLE  (libGLESv2.dylib, libEGL.dylib)  translates GL ES -> Metal
  |
  v
Metal.framework                         Apple silicon GPU
```

Two things this makes explicit. The guest sees a plain virtio GPU and needs no
Apple-specific driver. And the acceleration is real rather than a software
rasteriser: `libGLESv2.dylib` and `libEGL.dylib` link `Metal.framework`
directly, and the guest reports the renderer as
`ANGLE (Apple, ANGLE Metal Renderer: <chip>)`.

This chain is unchanged by the QEMU 11.1.1 move. That work touched the
interrupt controller and the GL scanout plumbing — how a rendered texture is
handed to the Cocoa window — not the rendering backend.

Note that the upstream tap this builds from is named
`homebrew-qemu-virgl-kosmickrisp`, but KosmicKrisp, Mesa's Vulkan-to-Metal
driver, is not part of this path.

### Not yet verified

Window resize across a HiDPI boundary, Mac output-device switching mid-session,
the shared folder, and clipboard sharing have not been exercised since the
port. The `dtc` mirror should be reverted once kernel.org returns.

## Quick start

My Omarchy does not yet have a product-qualified release. Do not publish or
redistribute the current legacy app as My Omarchy. Once the product-foundation
and release-gate specifications are complete, signed and notarized builds will
be published only through
[My Omarchy Releases](https://github.com/superops-team/my-omarchy/releases).
The remaining launch description documents the current implementation baseline.

Every launch begins at the start menu. While that menu is open, My Omarchy behaves like a regular Mac app with standard Quit, Close Window, and Minimize commands; after the VM starts, that native app chrome steps aside for Omarchy. **Immersive** is on by default, so Omarchy opens Full Screen with the Mac menu bar and Dock hidden. Turn it off to open a resizable window; if you later enter Full Screen, the Mac menu bar and Dock remain available at the screen edges. Whenever the Omarchy window is focused, Command belongs to the guest as Super in either mode; Accessibility permission lets system shortcuts such as Command-Space reach it before macOS. Microphone and camera access are optional. The launcher chooses a lightweight resource profile from the Mac's memory and active CPU count before QEMU starts: 8 GiB Macs use 4 vCPUs and 2560 MiB RAM, 16-23 GiB Macs use 4 vCPUs and 4096 MiB RAM, and larger Macs use 6 vCPUs and 4096 MiB RAM while reserving 2 CPUs for macOS. The first launch takes longer while the app prepares Linux and starts Omarchy's account provisioning.

Restarting from inside Omarchy reboots the guest in the same My Omarchy app.
Shutting down Omarchy closes the app and leaves it closed.

## 1Password

Install 1Password from the Omarchy menu. On ARM64 guests, My Omarchy downloads
the current official 1Password application, verifies its signature against the
pinned 1Password signing key, and installs the ARM64 CLI package. Its launcher
uses software rendering to avoid the virtual GPU incompatibility affecting the
Electron interface.

After signing in, use these global shortcuts:

- `Ctrl + Shift + Space` — open 1Password Quick Access
- `Super + Shift + /` — open the full 1Password app

## Camera sharing

Choose **Allow…** next to **Camera access** on the start menu to make the Mac's
FaceTime HD camera available in Omarchy as **Mac Camera**. The bridge publishes a
standard Linux V4L2 camera at `/dev/video42`, so browser calls and Linux camera
apps can use it without special configuration. Capture is on demand: the Mac
camera and its indicator turn on only while an Omarchy app is actively using
the virtual camera. Denying camera permission does not prevent Omarchy from
launching.

## Clipboard sharing

Copy and paste work in both directions as soon as you sign in to Omarchy: text
and PNG images copied on the Mac appear in the Omarchy clipboard, and content
copied in Omarchy lands on the Mac pasteboard. Nothing is transferred until
something is copied.

## Sharing a folder with the Mac

Folder sharing is off until you pick a folder. Use **Choose…** next to
**Shared folder** on the start menu to select one Mac folder; Omarchy links it
into its home under the same name (`~/Work` on the Mac becomes `~/Work` in
Omarchy) with full read and write access, so choose a folder you intend Linux
software to modify. The whole home folder, `~/Library`, and system directories
cannot be shared. **Turn Off** keeps the choice but stops exporting it on the
next launch; Omarchy then removes the link and gives back any standard folder
such as `~/Documents` that the link had taken over. The share belongs to the
first Omarchy account created during
provisioning. Additional guest accounts can reach the same share, with each
entry's normal Unix permission bits deciding whether they can modify it.

## Forwarding ports to Omarchy

Use **Configure…** next to **Port forwarding** on the start menu to map a Mac
localhost port to a service port in Omarchy. Each mapping can use TCP or UDP;
the same Mac port may be used once for each protocol. Forwarded ports bind only
to `127.0.0.1`, so other devices on the network cannot connect to them. The
service inside Omarchy must listen on `0.0.0.0` or the guest network interface,
not only on the guest's own localhost.

The reverse direction does not need a mapping. From Omarchy, connect to
`10.0.2.2:<Mac port>` to reach a service running on the Mac.

### SSH access

After completing Omarchy's first-boot account setup, open **Port forwarding**,
choose **Add SSH**, and save the prefilled TCP mapping from Mac port `2222` to
Omarchy port `22`. My Omarchy then requests `sshd` for boots that contain a TCP
mapping to guest port 22. It does not change guest accounts, `sshd_config`,
password policy, or authorized keys.

Connect with the username and password created inside Omarchy (the Mac username
is not assumed):

```sh
ssh -p 2222 <guest-user>@127.0.0.1
```

Once the initial password login works, install a key if desired:

```sh
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 <guest-user>@127.0.0.1
```

For a shorter command, add this to `~/.ssh/config` on the Mac:

```sshconfig
Host omarchy
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  Port 2222
  User <guest-user>
```

You can then use `ssh omarchy`, and the same alias works with `scp`, `rsync`,
Git, and VS Code Remote SSH. If you edit the preset's Mac port, substitute that
port in every command.

Factory Reset creates a new guest host key, and every ephemeral VM has its own
disposable host key. If OpenSSH reports that the key for the reused endpoint
changed, remove only that endpoint's old entry and reconnect to verify the new
fingerprint:

```sh
ssh-keygen -R '[127.0.0.1]:2222'
```

Loopback binding prevents devices on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or the wider LAN from
connecting. It does not isolate the listener from other users or processes on
the same Mac; guest SSH authentication is still required.

### Touch ID for sudo

The native authentication bridge can enroll this Mac and use
Touch ID as a sufficient authentication method for guest `sudo`. Open
**Omarchy Menu → Setup → Security → Touch ID for sudo**, or run:

```sh
my-omarchy-touch-id
```

The integration ships disabled. Enabling first requires the normal guest sudo
password, then Touch ID creates and proves possession of a Secure Enclave
signing key. Only after that succeeds is the narrowly scoped sudo PAM rule
installed. The menu then offers Test, Re-pair, and Disable actions.

The Mac stores only the Secure Enclave's device-bound encrypted key
representation. Every later approval is signed over a root-private guest ID,
fresh challenge, the sudo user and requesting user, the interactive TTY, and a
15-second validity window. Each enrolled guest has a distinct host signing key.
The QEMU window must be frontmost. Cancellation, invalid responses, missing
enrollment, and unavailable Touch ID all fall back to the normal guest password;
no login or screen-unlock PAM policy is changed.

If Touch ID falls back, sudo displays the reason before asking for the guest
password. Signed approvals require synchronized Mac and guest clocks; factory
images enable `systemd-timesyncd` at boot. On an existing guest with clock drift,
run `sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd.service`, then check
`timedatectl` for `System clock synchronized: yes` before retrying.

The Touch ID test refuses guest-password fallback and returns failure if sudo
cannot authenticate. A passwordless sudo policy can also satisfy this check;
the result only demonstrates Touch ID when its prompt appeared. Unanswered Mac
prompts are canceled after 55 seconds, before the guest's 65-second timeout.
Late responses are discarded without extending the current request's deadline.

Enrollment persists across guest and Mac restarts for the same persistent VM,
Mac, and macOS account. Factory Reset, moving the VM to another Mac or account,
or changing the enrolled Touch ID fingerprint set requires re-pairing. Disabling
removes the guest enrollment and, while the host bridge is available, its wrapped
Secure Enclave key representation.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (`arm64`)
- macOS 15 or newer
- At least 8 GB free initially

On M3 and newer Apple Silicon, My Omarchy also exposes ARM EL2 to Linux, so
the guest provides `/dev/kvm` for nested VMs and compatible VMMs. Older Apple
Silicon Macs automatically keep the normal non-nested launch path.

## Data and updates

Normal launches keep one persistent VM under
`~/Library/Application Support/My Omarchy/VM/v1`. Removing or updating the app
does not remove or replace this data. An existing VM keeps both its writable
disk and the exact kernel, initramfs, and base command line that were paired
with that disk. A newer app's bundled factory image is used only to create a
new VM, after a confirmed **Reset Omarchy**, or for an ephemeral launch.
Before Reset is enabled, the confirmation sheet requires typing `My Omarchy`
exactly; cancelling the sheet returns to the start menu without changing the VM.

VMs created before paired boot files were introduced are preserved too. On the
first launch that needs them, My Omarchy explains the transition in a
**Continue** / **Cancel** dialog before starting recovery. Continue performs a
one-time recovery boot: it mounts the saved disk read-only, copies the installed
kernel and initramfs from `/boot` into private VM storage, validates them, and
then shuts the recovery boot down. It does not start the saved userspace with
the newer app's kernel, reset the VM, or upgrade Omarchy. Cancel returns to the
start menu. Reset is still required when the saved storage or boot format
itself cannot be safely read.

Use Omarchy's built-in updater for the updates it supports inside this ARM
guest. Ordinary guest packages can advance without replacing the VM, but the
current factory still pins its direct-boot kernel and headers, packaged
`my-omarchy-runtime`, and reviewed compatibility backports in a prioritized
local repository. Installing a newer My Omarchy app therefore does not apply
all of that app's factory-image changes to an existing VM, and an in-guest
update should not be assumed to reproduce them. A confirmed reset is the
deliberate, destructive way to start again from the newest bundled factory.

### Growing an existing VM disk

To add capacity without resetting the VM, shut down Omarchy and run the
maintenance command from a source checkout on the Mac:

```sh
# Preview a new total capacity of 32 GiB.
macos/resize-vm-disk.sh --size-gib 32

# Retain a verified backup, then enlarge the stopped disk.
macos/resize-vm-disk.sh --size-gib 32 --apply
```

Run as the macOS user who owns the VM, without `sudo`. The command requires
Python 3 and an APFS volume, but does not require building the app. It uses the
same workspace lock as the launcher and refuses an active VM, shrinking,
unrecognized metadata, or a missing/invalid paired boot kit. An equal size is
a no-op. Whole-number targets up to 8192 GiB are accepted.

The default state directory is
`~/Library/Application Support/My Omarchy/VM/v1`. For a custom VM location,
pass `--state-root "/path/to/selected-folder/VM/v1"`, using the directory that
contains `.my-omarchy-storage` and `disks/current`. The command does not read
the app's saved location preference or select legacy development workspaces.

The backup is an APFS clone in a private sibling directory named
`v1.resize-backup.XXXXXX`; the command prints its exact path. It retains the
original disk, disk metadata, and paired boot files and verifies the disk's
checksum before resizing; reading both full disk images can take several
minutes. Keep it until the resized VM is working. To roll back, shut down the
VM and restore its original disk from this backup; any
writes made after the backup would be lost, so preserve the newer disk first.
Never shrink the enlarged disk to undo the operation.

The host must have free space for the requested increase plus 1 GiB of
headroom. Growth is sparse, not a reservation of host capacity, and retained
clones consume additional space as their contents diverge. On the next normal
boot, the guest's enabled `systemd-growfs-root.service` grows ext4 to fill the
disk. Verify inside Omarchy with `lsblk` and `df -h /`. No app rebuild, guest
reinstall, or change to the factory image is needed.

The QEMU root disk is launched with `discard=unmap`, and the factory guest
enables `fstrim.timer` so deleted files can be returned to the APFS sparse-file
backing store. Release qualification still needs the Phase 3 trim benchmark:
host allocated bytes must be measured before and after guest `fstrim`.

### Choosing where the VM lives

**Change…** on the start menu's **VM Location** row moves the VM to any folder
you pick, including one on an external drive. Omarchy uses exactly the folder
you choose — it never creates a folder inside it on your behalf.

- The folder must be **empty**, or one Omarchy has already used. A folder with
  other files in it, or a drive's top level, is turned away with an
  explanation instead of being restructured; create or pick an empty folder
  (for example, one named "My Omarchy") to use instead.
- The drive must be **APFS**. The VM disk grows as you use it, which only APFS
  supports here: on exFAT, FAT, or NTFS the same disk would claim its full size
  the moment it was created. Network volumes are refused because the VM's disk
  lock is unreliable on them. Anything else is turned away when you pick it, with
  the actual format named.
- You need roughly 7 GB free to create the VM, and up to 30 GB as it fills. The
  disk is sparse, so it only ever occupies what the guest has actually written.
- **Changing the location does not move your existing VM.** It stays where it
  is, and switching back reaches it again.
- Do not disconnect the drive while Omarchy is running. macOS refuses a normal
  eject while the VM holds the disk, but pulling the cable can damage it. If the
  volume does disappear, Omarchy shuts the VM down instead of writing on.
- **If the drive is not connected, Omarchy will not quietly use the default VM
  instead.** Launching offers to switch back to the default folder; resetting
  refuses outright, so a reset can never erase a workspace other than the one
  you confirmed. Opening the folder from the start menu will not recreate it on
  your startup disk either.

## Development requirements

- Xcode command-line tools with Swift 6
- Python 3
- `pkg-config` (Homebrew is the simplest way to install it)
- A running Docker-compatible engine that supports privileged `linux/arm64`
  containers
- Roughly 20 GB free for guest, runtime, caches, and assembled output

Install the one Homebrew build tool with:

```sh
brew install pkg-config
```

`make doctor` performs the basic preflight, including a SwiftPM build of the
test bundle with the repository-pinned Swift Testing dependency. The first run
may fetch the locked `swift-testing` and `swift-syntax` packages. `make runtime`
downloads a checksum-pinned `arm64_sequoia` dependency set, builds QEMU for
macOS 15.0, and rejects any runtime image that raises that minimum or strongly
imports an API unavailable on the declared platform. Installed Homebrew library
versions are never copied into the app.

## Build and run

For a first full build and launch:

```sh
make build run
```

The first build downloads pinned sources, assembles a multi-gigabyte guest, and
compiles QEMU, so it can take a while. `make build` includes the basic toolchain
check. Later builds hash the effective inputs and validate the existing outputs,
then rebuild only the guest, runtime, or app components that changed. To bypass
that cache deliberately, run `make build FORCE=1` (or add `FORCE=1` to an
individual component command).

Artifacts created before their `.build/state/` record exists are rebuilt once;
the cache never adopts an output whose successful inputs it did not observe.

The generated app lives under `dist/app.noindex/`. macOS can run and package
the bundle normally, but Spotlight will not present it beside an installed
copy as a second, indistinguishable Command-Space result. The first app rebuild
after this layout change removes the old generated bundle from `dist/`.

Launching also ensures that the guest, runtime, and native app are current, so
the normal follow-up command is:

```sh
make run
```

Run the complete contract and native test suite with:

```sh
make test
```

Run `make help` for component builds, persistent-storage reset, ephemeral mode, and cleanup commands.

To reclaim development build space, run:

```sh
make clean
```

This removes all repository build output, the native and guest build caches,
and My Omarchy's project-scoped Docker builder image and work volumes. It does
not touch a developer's persistent VM.

For a complete local reset, first quit My Omarchy and then run:

```sh
make clean-all
```

The deep cleanup also permanently deletes the current user's My Omarchy VM
disks and app state, plus stale My Omarchy build and test directories in the
macOS temporary directories. It only selects Docker resources and temporary
paths owned by this project; it does not run a global Docker or system prune.
To prevent accidental data loss, the command requires an interactive terminal
and only proceeds after the developer types `clean-all` at the confirmation
prompt.

## Packaging and releases

All generated output has one predictable home:

```text
dist/
├── app.noindex/
│   └── My Omarchy.app
├── MyOmarchy.dmg        # after make package or make release
└── guest/                # verified guest build artifacts
```

Both DMG targets create distributable artifacts:

- `make package` rebuilds the app, Developer ID-signs the app and DMG,
  notarizes the DMG with Apple, and staples the notarization tickets. It uses
  `PACKAGE_SIGN_IDENTITY` and `PACKAGE_NOTARY_PROFILE`, which default to the
  configured release credentials, and fails instead of producing an
  unnotarized fallback.
- `make release` performs the same signing and notarization workflow with the
  release-specific credential variables.

Maintainers should follow [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for the full build, test, signing, license, corresponding-source, and verification checklist.
